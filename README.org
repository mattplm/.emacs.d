#+TITLE: My personal emacs config

The configuration is currently organised in files under the =lisp= directory.

It is organised in =use-package= declarations.

The theme is the amazing =modus-operandi= by [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos Stavrou aka Prot]].

* Using this config

Please use with care, this repo might change a lot and is tailored for my use,
which is probably not suitable for everyone. The configuration is used every day
at work with *GNU Emacs version 28.1*.

I cannot guaranty that it will work on any other version of Emacs. Actually, I'm
currently writing this on my personnal rig with an compiled version of *Emacs
29.0.50* (outdated master from earlier this year), and it seems like some
features don't work properly.

* Some notable key bindings

* Presentation view

This is a special view for when I share my screen with someone. For now, it
simply toggles the modus-theme from =modus-oprandi= to =modus-vivendi= (because
people seem to like to complain about light themes ðŸ˜‰), enables =nlinum-mode=
and =hl-line-mode= to make it clearer where my cursor is in the buffer to the
viewer. See [[file:lisp/init-functions.el::defun mp/toggle-presentation-view (][this function]].
